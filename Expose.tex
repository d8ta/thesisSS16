\subsection{Working Title: Continuous Integration and Automatization in Modern Web Applications unsing NodeJS}

\subsection{Achievement}
The Mayor goal of this thesis is to show how to establish a modern development operation cycle for
web applications using Node.js and the MEAN stack. For this i will citeing the standard literature and methods for continuous
integration and deployment and show how to build them in a safe and stable way with Node.js and the
the other Parts of the MEAN stack.

\subsection{Research Question}
How to implement Continuous Integration, Continuous Development, Automatization and Testing for a Modern Web Applications
using the MEAN Stack and NodeJS in a stable way and practical way.

\subsection{Methods}
First i will describe the implementation process of continuous integration, based on research of the basic litratur for this
topic. Appart from this the thesis will provide data from the impementation cycle at the neolexon webapplication.
This data will show if the choosen methods and implementation are stable and if they will provide process to the deployment
and development of the application.
