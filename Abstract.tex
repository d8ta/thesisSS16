\subsection*{Abstract} 
Privacy and safety in web applications are a major concern for today's users and developers. Surveillance measures and the complexity of software systems and applications are the main reasons. Today, users are more connected through the web than ever before and new technologies are having a deep impact on their lives, jobs and relationships \cite{javaid2013cyber}. Web applications and new technologies are a black box, if you are not a software developer or an experienced user. Because of this, it is necessary to develop software and applications that provide standards for users to take care of privacy and safety issues. This research will primarily describe the meaning of privacy and safety in a technical way. Secondly, it will research what developers can contribute to promote user privacy in web applications. The last part concentrates on the subject of standardization and how measures can be standardized for the development process in a useful and verifiable way \cite{defranco2013every}.
