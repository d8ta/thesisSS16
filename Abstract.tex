\subsection*{Abstract}
Building modern web applications that can scale and have no downtime is one of the key features for todays development teams. Since there
is a major difference between other engineering branches and the software engineering industry the development teams should not use
the regular techniques, which divide design and construction. The main difference is that the design process is the main process in
software engineering and that design and construction are not divided. For implementing a methodology and workflow that supports
this kind of approach, agile software management was invented. On of the technological aspects of an agile software development is that
of continuous integration of new code and software. Changes are happening many times in software projects. To have a stable and running
software system or web applications means flexibility and confidence in an application. This thesis describes the process of how to setup
a continuous integration cycle in a best practice example, with modern web development techniques like the MEAN stack, NodeJS and open
source continuous integration service striderCD.
