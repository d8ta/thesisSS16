\subsection*{Abstract}
Building modern web applications that are scalable and have no downtime, is one of the key features for todays development teams. Since there
is a major difference between other engineering branches and the software engineering industry, the development teams should not use
regular techniques, which divide design and construction. The main difference is that design is the main process in
software engineering. Design and construction are not divided. For implementing a methodology and workflow that supports
this kind of approach, agile software management was invented. The technological aspects of agile software development is continuously integrat new code and software into the project. Changes are happening during the whole times of the development process. To have a stable and running
software system or web applications means flexibility and confidence in the application. This thesis describe the process of set up
a continuous integration cycle in a best practice example, with modern web development techniques like the MEAN stack, NodeJS and the open
source continuous integration service striderCD.
