@misc{Keerthi2014,
	Abstract = {As mobile computing applications have become commonplace, it is increasingly important for them to address end-users' privacy requirements. Mobile privacy requirements depend on a number of contextual socio-cultural factors to which mobility adds another level of contextual variation. However, traditional requirements elicitation methods do not sufficiently account for contextual factors and therefore cannot be used effectively to represent and analyse the privacy requirements of mobile end users. On the other hand, methods that investigate contextual factors tend to produce data which can be difficult to use for requirements modelling. To address this problem, we have developed a Distillation approach that employs a problem analysis model to extract and refine privacy requirements for mobile applications from raw data gathered through empirical studies involving real users. Our aim was to enable the extraction of mobile privacy requirements that account for relevant contextual factors while contributing to the software design and implementation process. A key feature of the distillation approach is a problem structuring framework called privacy facets (PriF). The facets in the PriF framework support the identification of privacy requirements from different contextual perspectives namely - actors, information, information-flows and places. The PriF framework also aids in uncovering privacy determinants and threats that a system must take into account in order to support the end-user's privacy. In this work, we first show the working of distillation using qualitative data taken from an empirical study which involved social-networking practices of mobile users. As a means of validating distillation, another distinctly separate qualitative dataset from a location-tracking study is used, in both cases, the empirical studies relate to privacy issues faced by real users observed in their mobile environment.},

	Abstract = {Todays competitive and profit-driven online environment needs a web appli- cation to be much secure as it is going to be tested in all possible ways by the attackers for any sign of vulnerability which can be converted into a big success for him to gain control to the maximum of the software. In order to produce a secure application, it has to be securely built right from the design phase throughout the software development life cycle. The most effective methodology of implementing this is threat modeling. There have been a lot of improvements and researches on the process of threat modeling and its approaches. Following these, Some tools are developed by some Enterprises to support the process of systematic threat modeling. In this thesis, the most widely accepted process of threat modeling, that has been proposed by Microsoft, is explained along with other approaches for it. Two industrial projects, with the support of Microsoft SDL tool for Threat modeling have been threat modeled and discussed. Towards the end, some modifications to the hybrid approach of threat modeling have been proposed and have been implemented on the open source workbench supporting that approach.},

@book{Glaser2014,
	Abstract = {The world is becoming increasingly mobile. Smartphones and tablets have become more powerful and popular, with many of these devices now containing confidential business, financial, and personal information. This has led to a greater focus on mobile software security. Establishing mobile software security should be of primary concern to every mobile application developer. This book explains how you can create mobile social applications that incorporate security throughout the development process. Although there are many books that address security issues, most do not explain how to incorporate security into the building process. Secure Development for Mobile Apps does exactly that. Its step-by-step guidance shows you how to integrate security measures into social apps running on mobile platforms. You'll learn how to design and code apps with security as part of the process and not an afterthought. The author outlines best practices to help you build better, more secure software. This book provides a comprehensive guide to techniques for secure development practices. It covers PHP security practices and tools, project layout templates, PHP and PDO, PHP encryption, and guidelines for secure session management, form validation, and file uploading. The book also demonstrates how to develop secure mobile apps using the APIs for Google Maps, YouTube, jQuery Mobile, Twitter, and Facebook. While this is not a beginner's guide to programming, you should have no problem following along if you've spent some time developing with PHP and MySQL.},

	Abstract = {Cyberspace is a ubiquitous realm interconnecting every aspect of modern society, enabled by broadband networks and wireless signals around us, existing within local area networks in our schools, hospitals and businesses, and within the massive grids that power most countries. Securing cyberspace to ensure the continuation of growing economies and to protect a nation's way of life is a major concern for governments around the globe. This book contains papers presented at the NATO Advanced Research Workshop (ARW) entitled Best Practices and Innovative Approaches to Develop Cyber Security and Resiliency Policy Framework, held in Ohrid, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), in June 2013. The workshop aimed to develop a governing policy framework for nation states to enhance the cyber security of critical infrastructure. The 12 papers included herein cover a wide range of topics from web security and end-user training, to effective implementation of national cyber security policies and defensive countermeasures. The book will be of interest to cyber security professionals, practitioners, policy-makers, and to all those for whom cyber security is a critical and an important aspect of their work.},
